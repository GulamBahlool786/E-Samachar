This is inspired by the thought that why we can't search and read at the same place.
News is notoriously known for its twisted and fancy way of feed which makes it hard for the people who read to improve English
So an extra feature of searching word meanings with examples is added.

Run the main.html after extracting the zip file.
It Uses API for fetching news and Meaning of the word. (Only for educational use only, Not for deployment purpose.)
